# TheCycleItemsList
A web-based tool to track which items you need in The Cycle: Frontier.

To run the code, you'll need Python3 with flask, BeautifulSoup4, mechanicalsoup, requests, and shutil.
Once those are installed, run "python3 app.py" to run locally.
Navigate to "localhost" in your browser, and there you'll see the page.

The website is a work in progress, but currently, the need/want lists can be populated by dragging items from the item list on the left to the need/want boxes on the right. Eventually, the buttons for +/- will be implemented and let you adjust your current amount and the amount you need.

Currently, there is no saving between website opens, so your lists will be lost every time you reload the website. This is also a todo item. 

Thanks for your patience! I hope to make this website available at some point in the future!
